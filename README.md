# cMakeMake
a tool to generate template cmake projects

simple and ok,

mostly a personal use project so do not expect it to be maintained or updated
this uses CLI argments to generate a CMakeLists.txt file and created a project folder.

new: the cli argmnets set the source files

scripts are all un obfuscated the tar.gz (found in cmakemake/cmake_default_*-*.tar.gz) is the project template with source files.
