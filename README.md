# cMakeMake
a tool to generate template cmake projects

simple and ok,

mostly a personal use project so do not expect it to be maintained or updated
this uses CLI argments to generate a CMakeLists.txt file and created a project folder.

the template files are c++ and reguler headers.
if you wish to use c or h++ files you have to manually replace them yourselves.

scripts are all un obfuscated the tar.gz is the project template.
